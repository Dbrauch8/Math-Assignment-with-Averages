# testAverages
This is my first successful program where I call methods! 

There is a menu method and four primary methods for performing math functions (corresponding to each part of the assignment). 
An additional "helper" method converts raw test scores into letter grades for the test scores enteres. It is called within three of the primary methods. 


The requirements are listed below. 
********************
1. Basic Difficulty
Sum of numbers
Create a console application that will accept ten numbers between 0 and 100, and report their sum.

********************
2. Average ten scores
Create a console application that will accept ten test scores between 0 and 100, average them, and report a letter grade for 
the average based on the usual scale. 
For example, a teacher will input ten test scores and see the average numerical grade and the letter grade.

********************
3. Intermediate Difficulty
Average a specific number of scores
Create a console application that will accept an arbitrary number test scores (as specified by the user) 
between 0 and 100, average them, and report a letter grade for the average based on the usual scale. 
For example, a teacher will input the total number of tests, then input ten test scores and see the average numerical grade and the letter grade.

********************
4. Advanced Difficulty
Average a non-specific number of scores
Create a console application that will accept a number test scores (as calculated by the number of scores actually entered) 
between 0 and 100, average them, and report a letter grade for the average based on the usual scale. 
For example, a teacher will input any number test scores, and see the average numerical grade and the letter grade.
